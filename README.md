# IGNORE THIS REPO
To my chagrin, this rabbit hole was chased down into due to me not verifying ChatGPT first on its advice. 

### ts-node-esm
Fork of ts-node-esm since it is broken on npmjs.org

### TL;DR
The [original package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-esm/v/0.0.6) on npmjs.org by Arjay Elbore, last updated 3 years ago at the time of this writing, has an incorrectly specified `"peerDependencies"` section in its `package.json`. Working on setting up a new ESM TypeScript package, I wanted to have access to this work, simple though it may be. While the npmjs page does not specify the github repo, it does show the sourcecode and the package is specified as being MIT licensed, so voila, here we are.

## Licensing
The original works are MIT licensed, so are any changes I make. It'll be published on npmjs.org as @nyteshade/ts-node-esm. Feel free to republish or fork as you see fit. The original code is the work of (Arjay Elbore)[https://www.npmjs.com/~aelbore].
